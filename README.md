> FSharp.Control.AsyncRx is a lightweight Async Reactive (AsyncRx) library for F#.

FSharp.Control.AsyncRx is a library for asynchronous reactive
programming, and is the implementation of Async Observables
([ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)) for F#. FSharp.Control.AsyncRx makes
it easy to compose and combine streams of asynchronous event-based data
such as timers, mouse-moves, keyboard input, web requests and enables
you to do operations such as:

- Filtering
- Transforming
- Aggregating
- Combining
- Time-shifting

FSharp.Control.AsyncRx was designed specifically for targeting
[Fable](http://fable.io/) which means that the code may be
[transpiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to
JavaScript, and thus the same F# code may be used both client and server
side for full stack software development.
